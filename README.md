## What I Learned from Building This Project

1. **Code Formatting**: Learned to format all files consistently using Prettier – `npx prettier . --write`.
2. **Package Hygiene**: Discovered `npx sort-package-json` to auto-sort dependencies and keep `package.json` clean.
3. **OCR Integration**: Built an OCR pipeline to extract text from PNG files.
4. **AI Integration**: Connected and interacted with the OpenAI API to enhance capabilities.
5. **Environment Flexibility**: Set up dynamic environments for both production and development.
6. **Real-Time UX**: Integrated Socket.IO to stream progress updates in real-time during file processing.
7. **Git Hooks**: Used Husky to enforce pre-commit checks and boost code quality.
8. **E2E Testing**: Set up and configured Playwright for robust end-to-end testing.
9. **CI/CD**: Leveraged GitHub Actions to run tests automatically on each commit.
10. **Documentation First**: Got hands-on with technical docs for Socket.IO, Playwright, Husky, and YAML — leveling up my DevOps game.
11. **UI Enhancements**: Built custom tooltips and made dynamic UI improvements for better UX.
12. **React Hooks**: Created custom React hooks for shared logic across components.
13. **React Context**: Implemented and used React's `createContext` and `useContext` for state management.
14. **Vite Environment Variables**: Learned how to manage environment variables with Vite.
15. **Learned slightly about docker**: Learned why docker is important once I use tools of .net and etc in order to be used on deployed clouds.
